Be it the way it looked or the way it involved the driver from behind the wheel. It is so impressive that it easily sets the new standard for the segment with a far wider cache of abilities than ever. The India-spec X5 can be had with both petrol and diesel engine options. The X5 xDrive40i is powered by a 3.0-litre inline-six petrol engine that produces 340PS of power and 450Nm of torque. The xDrive30d, on the other hand, gets a 3.0-litre inline-six diesel unit that makes 265PS and 620Nm. Both variants get an 8-speed automatic transmission and a rear-biased all-wheel-drive system.\",\n\t\"seater\": 5,\n\t\"rentPerDay\": 2500,\n\t\"available\": true\n}"},"created":1589286225875,"description":"*Points to remember:*\n\n1) This service call can add a car into the database online in cars collection.\n\n2) A car can be added by passing the details of the car like basic details(including name, seater, description, etc.) and booking details.
